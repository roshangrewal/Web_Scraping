Since 2015, Simpl has been helping e-commerce merchants separate the buying(the fun part) from the paying(OTPs, payment failures, ugh..). Instead of forcing users to authenticate every transaction, Simpl carries out sophisticated background authentication using device and transaction-level data - allowing you to transact with just 1 tap. After all, how many devices and delivery addresses does a regular user have anyway?

All your transactions, across merchants, get added to one bill - which you pay once in two weeks. This separation of buying from the paying opens the possibility for breakthrough customer experiences on apps like Zomato, bigbasket, MakeMyTrip, Grofers, dunzo and BookMyShow.

In order to create these experiences for consumers and merchants, our team is composed of engineers, analysts, designers, operations leads and more, all excited by the possibility of taking a sledgehammer to the status quo, every day.
