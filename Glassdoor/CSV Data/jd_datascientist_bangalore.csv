Since 2015, Simpl has been helping e-commerce merchants separate the buying(the fun part) from the paying(OTPs, payment failures, ugh..). Instead of forcing users to authenticate every transaction, Simpl carries out sophisticated background authentication using device and transaction-level data - allowing you to transact with just 1 tap. After all, how many devices and delivery addresses does a regular user have anyway?

All your transactions, across merchants, get added to one bill - which you pay once in two weeks. This separation of buying from the paying opens the possibility for breakthrough customer experiences on apps like Zomato, bigbasket, MakeMyTrip, Grofers, dunzo and BookMyShow.

In order to create these experiences for consumers and merchants, our team is composed of engineers, analysts, designers, operations leads and more, all excited by the possibility of taking a sledgehammer to the status quo, every day.

Simpl (getsimpl.com) was formed in 2015 by Nitya Sharma, an investment banker from Wall Street and Chaitra Chidanand, a tech executive from the Valley, when they teamed up with a very clear mission - to make money simple, so that people can live well and do amazing things.

Simpl is the payment platform for the mobile-first world, and we’re backed by some of the best names in fintech globally (folks who have invested in Visa, Square and Transferwise), and has Joe Saunders, Ex Chairman and CEO of Visa as a board member.

Everyone at Simpl is an internal entrepreneur who is given a lot of bandwidth and resources to create the next breakthrough towards the long term vision of “making money Simpl”.

Our first product is a payment platform that lets people buy instantly, anywhere online, and pay later. In the background, Simpl uses big data for credit underwriting, risk and fraud modelling, all without any paperwork, and enables Banks and Non-Bank Financial Companies to access a whole new consumer market.

Responsibilities

You will be focused on making sure of data correctness and accessibility, and building scalable systems to access/process it. Another major responsibility is helping AI/ML Engineers write better code. You will also build scalable, high performance data intensive services.

Examples:

- We have data pipelines processing aggregate and statistical data. Should we store this

in Redshift, in flat files in S3, or somewhere else?

- How should we structure our data pipelines?

- We need to track various data points to identify our customers in various locations, including from different devices, and determine that two seemingly disparate users are actually the same. How can we do this efficiently and effectively?

Your job is to understand what we’re trying to build, make informed choices about this and then get us going.

Example interview questions:

- Consider the query `SELECT * FROM foo INNER JOIN bar ON foo.x = bar.x WHERE foo.primary_key = ?`. What happens if you run this in Postgres? How does that differ if you run it in Redshift, or SparkSQL?

- Suppose we store a table in flat CSV files on S3. What kinds of jobs is this good for, and bad for? How is Parquet or BerkeleyDB different?

- What data structures are good for storing a graph, assuming the common query is finding a connected component?

On these questions, we’re primarily interested in computer science fundamentals. A good answer might be “a B-Tree, with keys structured as ...”. A bad answer might be be “use Neo4J, I don’t know how it works but it’s fast”."

We help marketers send timely and relevant messages to the right people. Because we can authoritatively tell a client exactly who is calling or connecting with them, we make critical real-time responses possible.

By linking the most essential information with the people who depend on it, we provide more than 12,000 clients worldwide with decisions—not just data.

The workday stretches into late evenings and you’d find yourself talking to the client, presenting insights from work and engaging the clients in discussions around growth and future pipeline development. You would have to work on defining this pipeline and ensuring growth is driven by great delivery and satisfactory client engagement
In short, a day would involve delivery – be it brainstorming on a project, QCing codes on Python/R/SAS or whatever technology it takes, preparing a deck for delivering insights and growth, collaborating with the India Leadership to come up with new ideas and solution design, driving client conversations centered around growth and guiding team members across the lifecycle of the engagement

Opportunity to work with most dynamic individuals in Asia recognised under Forbes 30 Under 30 and industry stalwarts from across companies like Microsoft, Paypal, Gravitas, Parksons, ITC, Snapdeal, Fedex, Deloitte and HUL.
Working in Bizongo translates into being a part of a dynamic start-up with some of the most enthusiastic, hardworking and intelligent people in a fast paced and electrifying environment.
Bizongo has been awarded as the most Disruptive Procurement Startup of the year - 2017.
This year ,Bizongo was awarded the highly prestigious & internationally acclaimed 'The DieLine Award' under the Sustainable Packaging category.
Being a company that is expanding itself every day and working towards exploring newer avenues in the market, every employee grows with the company.
The position provides a chance to build on existing talents, learn new skills and gain valuable experience in the field of Ecommerce.

About the Company:

Company Website: https://www.bizongo.in
Any solution worth anything is unfailingly preceded by clear articulation of a problem worth solving. Even a modest study of Indian Packaging industry would lead someone to observe the enormous fragmentation, chaos and rampant unreliability pervading the ecosystem. When businesses are unable to cope even with these basic challenges, how can they even think of materializing an eco-friendly & resource-efficient packaging economy? These are some hardcore problems with real-world consequences which our country is hard-pressed to solve.
Bizongo was conceived as an answer to these first level challenges of disorganization in the industry. We employed technology to build a business model that can streamline the packaging value-chain & has enormous potential to scale sustainably. Our potential to fill this vacuum was recognized early on by Accel Partners and IDG Ventures who jointly led our Series A funding. Most recently, B Capital group, a global tech fund led by Facebook co-founder Mr. Eduardo Savarin, invested in our technological capabilities when it jointly led our Series B funding with IFC.
The International Finance Corporation (IFC), the private-sector investment arm of the World Bank, cited our positive ecosystem impact towards the network of 30,000 SMEs operating in the packaging industry, as one of the core reasons for their investment decision. Beyond these bastions of support, we are extremely grateful to have found validation by various authoritative institutions including Forbes 30 Under 30 Asia. Being the only major B2B player in the country with such an unprecedented model has lent us enormous scope of experimentation in our efforts to break new grounds. Dreaming and learning together thus, we have grown from a team of 3, founded in 2015, to a 250+ strong family with office presence across Mumbai, Gurgaon and Bengaluru. So those who strive for opportunities to rise above their own limitations, who seek to build an ecosystem of positive change and to find remarkable solutions to challenges where none existed before, such creators would find a welcome abode in Bizongo.
