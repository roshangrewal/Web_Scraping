Our Product



Clarisights is a SaaS product that enables marketers to gain better insight from their ads and analytics data. Marketers have to deal with data incoming from multiple siloed sources such as ad networks, web analytics, in-app analytics and inhouse customer data. Collating all this data, exporting it, and later analysing it is often an manual job which is tedious, error prone and very limited. Clarisights solves this problem by stitching in data aggregation, data warehousing and data visualisation into one seamless interface. Marketers can connect their data sources to our platform, streaming all the ad and analytics data to our backend, then can run computations on that data, have custom visualisations, drill down / roll up, and query by any other metric. It gives marketers superpowers by helping them make sense of all their data without any of the pain.

The Role



We hit product market fit in early 2018, bagged a few top tier customers and even managed to close a $2 Million seed round from top European VCs. We're embarking on the next phases of our revolutionary business intelligence product and need dedicated and world-class frontend web expertise to help build and scale a highly performant web frontend.

We are looking for a frontend developer who has experience in building and shipping frontend applications, ideally fairly involved frontend apps. He/She should have good working knowledge of Javascript, browser and related technologies. Knowledge of best practices in frontend architecture, including performance, accessibility and usability.

This role will involve -


Understanding the product inside out, figure out the major components of the product and how they interact with each other.

Build user interfaces that are consistent, accessible, pixel-perfect, and fast, that are customisable as per the varying use cases. Create reusable and maintainable frontend systems and abstractions.

Our dashboards heavily use different visualisations and each tables handles 100s of thousands of rows. Architect and build highly interactive interfaces and visualisations that scale with optimal performance.

Work with React, ES6, TypeScript and HTML/CSS to build and maintain new Clarisights' features.

Dive deep into the usage of coding patterns and contribute in curating a library of reusable components that can be used

Experimenting with new libraries, APIs and patterns - figuring out which ones are a good fit for us to help us scale.



Our Tech Stack



On the backend we use Ruby on Rails for the API, MongoDB and Postgres for the datastore, Docker and Kubernetes for the infrastructure, all hosted on the Google cloud platform.

For the frontend we use Webpack, Flow, Babel, ReactJS, Redux and Redux Saga. We also use react virtualised and highcharts for data visualisation. We test using Jest and Enzyme.

REQUIREMENTS



Our job doesnt begin with a feature request or end with a deploy - our ideal team member is someone who is a self-initiator, identifies what we should work on, figures out how best to tackle it, and isnt satisfied until its done right. He/she will have experience build frontend applications and would have a good knowledge of Javascript, browser and related technologies.


1+ Years of experience building frontend applications. Ideally you've shipped something in production (either in a company or your own projects). Having built more things is an advantage.

Familiarity with any modern frontend JavaScript framework (Angular, Vue, React, etc) and tooling (Webpack, Parcel, Babel). Having dabbled in React previously is a bonus.

Working knowledge of semantic html and css. You don't have to be a frontend guru, but knowing what to search for when you're stuck is a helpful skill to have.

Computational thinking and basic knowledge of data structures and algorithms.

You understand version control and have used something like git.

Good sense of UI design and/or backend knowledge is a plus.


BENEFITS




You will be joining us at the perfect stage in our company - were neither a struggling startup, nor a slow moving established company. Weve found product market fit and are doubling down and scaling our product. You not only get to see all aspects of the product but also learn how a company is built and scaled from ground up. Expect to have three years worth of experience compressed into one.

Youll have all the opportunity to tackle hard problems, experiment and take risks - even if it means failing. The engineering problems here will let you deal with scale, performance and complexity. You will be helping us scale our data ingestion pipeline for handling petabytes of data as opposed to hundreds of GB of data it handles today; handle huge amounts of data to visualise in the react frontend while still keeping everything responsive and highly performant.

Work with a great team of people who have a track record of shipping and scaling some solid products at companies like Facebook, Google, Nutanix and Freshdesk. We contribute to popular OSS libraries and are planning to open source a few of our own open source tools - both backend and frontend.

We care about your personal development - you get access to books, courses and subscriptions, we get in external mentors when necessary. We encourage you to attend meetups and conferences. We just dont want you to build great stuff but want you to become great at building great stuff.

Ideate, experiment, share your work with others. We will encourage you to write blog posts, give talks and contribute to open source. If youve done something brilliant we dont hide it, in fact we go out of our way to promote it to the external world.

We are like a big family! Weve turned a nice bungalow into our office and even have a full time cook. Were redoing parts of our office, you get to decide how the office you work in looks like.

We have a flexible and open culture. Bring your own device - Mac / Windows / Linux. We provide you with the monitors, keyboards and anything else you need to get stuff done. You will have great pay, a flexible schedule, work from home option and generous vacation time.

About You

We are Hiver. We are a bunch of folks with borderline devotional love for email, committed to the idea of making it noise-free and collaborative for teams.

We love to laugh, eat Biryani, strum guitar and drink some ale like most startups but what really makes us come alive is when you throw a complex problem at us and casually drop the word ‘impossible’ with it.

We are an 80-member team and we come from different parts of the country. We don’t care what you wear, what language you speak or what’s your opinion about Biryani. Diversity is a friend and ‘empathy’ and ‘humility’ are not just big words on the walls. (Actually, the walls have Jimi Hendrix). We care deeply for our work and each other and find great joy in coming to work.
Opportunity

We’re looking for a Full Stack developer who will take a key role on our team and contribute to the product development. You’ll be working in an agile cross-functional team with other talented developers, QA and UX engineers. You’ll be working on end to end product features and be involved with releasing them to thousands of users all over the world. We care about the code that we ship. We care if a code manages to clock O(n log n) rather than O(n2). You will get to see what good engineering practices look like and how to build and ship fast.

What will you be doing?

Develop new user-facing features as well as improving the existing ones

Ensure the technical feasibility of a feature working with the Product Owner

Ensure that the code you write meet our quality standards

Optimize code for speed and scalability

Monitoring uptime and performance of product features owned by your team

Collaborate with team members to resolve blockers and maintain our feature shipping speed
