What your typical day will look like?

Meet with the team of apprentice leaders in your team to identify and mitigate potential gaps in a client engagement, generating between $2M - $10M USD in revenue. Take actions to ensure healthy growth of the engagement – with focus on high quality delivery, client relationships and employee engagement
Collaborate with the client services team to assess and take decisions regarding the health of the engagement
Work with other ALs to prioritize high priority problems that need immediate attention. Typically, these business problems cannot be solved using a linear/single line of thought.

Collaborate with the various business functions in Mu Sigma, like Sales, Marketing, Mu Sigma University, Talent Management and Delivery & Innovation, helping them from your experiences in delivery, and learning their way of operating, in return
You’ll also make time to attend meetings with the India Leadership and client services leadership, discussing the progress of your engagement, highlighting the highs and lows of your engagement and asking for help across the organization
The workday stretches into late evenings and you’d find yourself talking to the client, presenting insights from work and engaging the clients in discussions around growth and future pipeline development. You would have to work on defining this pipeline and ensuring growth is driven by great delivery and satisfactory client engagement
In short, a day would involve delivery – be it brainstorming on a project, QCing codes on Python/R/SAS or whatever technology it takes, preparing a deck for delivering insights and growth, collaborating with the India Leadership to come up with new ideas and solution design, driving client conversations centered around growth and guiding team members across the lifecycle of the engagement

Opportunity to work with most dynamic individuals in Asia recognised under Forbes 30 Under 30 and industry stalwarts from across companies like Microsoft, Paypal, Gravitas, Parksons, ITC, Snapdeal, Fedex, Deloitte and HUL.
Working in Bizongo translates into being a part of a dynamic start-up with some of the most enthusiastic, hardworking and intelligent people in a fast paced and electrifying environment.
Bizongo has been awarded as the most Disruptive Procurement Startup of the year - 2017.
This year ,Bizongo was awarded the highly prestigious & internationally acclaimed 'The DieLine Award' under the Sustainable Packaging category.
Being a company that is expanding itself every day and working towards exploring newer avenues in the market, every employee grows with the company.
The position provides a chance to build on existing talents, learn new skills and gain valuable experience in the field of Ecommerce.

About the Company:

Company Website: https://www.bizongo.in
Any solution worth anything is unfailingly preceded by clear articulation of a problem worth solving. Even a modest study of Indian Packaging industry would lead someone to observe the enormous fragmentation, chaos and rampant unreliability pervading the ecosystem. When businesses are unable to cope even with these basic challenges, how can they even think of materializing an eco-friendly & resource-efficient packaging economy? These are some hardcore problems with real-world consequences which our country is hard-pressed to solve.
Bizongo was conceived as an answer to these first level challenges of disorganization in the industry. We employed technology to build a business model that can streamline the packaging value-chain & has enormous potential to scale sustainably. Our potential to fill this vacuum was recognized early on by Accel Partners and IDG Ventures who jointly led our Series A funding. Most recently, B Capital group, a global tech fund led by Facebook co-founder Mr. Eduardo Savarin, invested in our technological capabilities when it jointly led our Series B funding with IFC.
The International Finance Corporation (IFC), the private-sector investment arm of the World Bank, cited our positive ecosystem impact towards the network of 30,000 SMEs operating in the packaging industry, as one of the core reasons for their investment decision. Beyond these bastions of support, we are extremely grateful to have found validation by various authoritative institutions including Forbes 30 Under 30 Asia. Being the only major B2B player in the country with such an unprecedented model has lent us enormous scope of experimentation in our efforts to break new grounds. Dreaming and learning together thus, we have grown from a team of 3, founded in 2015, to a 250+ strong family with office presence across Mumbai, Gurgaon and Bengaluru. So those who strive for opportunities to rise above their own limitations, who seek to build an ecosystem of positive change and to find remarkable solutions to challenges where none existed before, such creators would find a welcome abode in Bizongo.
